# Events for your unique taste

Discovering events has traditionally been manual work. We follow social media, our favourite artists, venues, magazines…
whatevs. Being active in all that takes time, and there's always a great chance to miss out.

The best expierence so far? A friend telling me about an event. Possibly even ask to go with me. That friend knows my
musical taste, so I don’t get spammed with everything happening, only the things that matter.

## Let the machine take care of it

Straight and simple, here's how it works:

1. You set up event radars for your chosen locations.
2. Those radars filter events by artists or genres of your liking.
3. When something matches, you'll be the first to know.

Under the hood, we collect event data from all over the world. We enrich it, refine it, and make it make sense.

If you're the first in your area to set up a radar, you'll get a badge. It's 100% pixel.

## Ok, we're not your friends like personally

Unfortunately, we cant be _that_ friend. As much as we like to share a cold one, time and space are cruel. Still, we'd
like to be the ones who you tell your unique taste and in return we'll ping you when something interesting is about to
happen.

## But I like the chase!

If finding something on your own is what lights up your fire, we have a proposition for you too. Tell us about your
findings and become the respected member of the community. There are badges… and oh my, they're shiny.

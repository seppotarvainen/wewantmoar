# Moar together

We're concert-goers that simply enjoy the concert-going part of the whole experience. We're not fans of figuring out
what's happening and where. We just want to enjoy live music.

Maybe others feel the same? As developers, we thought the solution was simple: gather events and filter them to your specific taste.

Well… turned out we were wrong.

Even the best sources forget who's actually playing and where. And just because someone is playing Metallica doesn't mean
_Metallica_ is playing. Yes, there's that kind of data.

## Enter the community

The real challenge is turning unstructured into structured. Something that machines understand. WeWantMoar enriches the 
data with both the oldest and the latest tech, but it still isn’t 100 % accurate. The better the data, the better the service.

That's where the power of many comes in.

Fix a few details here and there, and we'll provide you the shiniest of badges – badges you can show the world.
(Yes, yes, access to paid features too. But those badges… They're really something.)

## The solution

So basically our solution goes like this:

* Phase 1: Collect event data
* Phase 2: ?
* Phase 3: Profit!

You, kind stranger, are with us at the question mark.

# You deserve moar

Everyone hates it. Missing out, I mean.

And there are so many reasons we're missing out. We might be missing out willingly. That's fine.
We might be missing out because something more important just came up. That's understandable too.

But sometimes it is simply because we heard of the thing a moment too late. Or because 
we didn't hear about the thing at all. Those cases, we believe, can be solved.

WeWantMoar helps you discover events you'd actually enjoy. Before they're gone.

## It's all over the place

It's not just one problem to be solved. With bigger concerts and A-list performers the problem is that 
the tickets are sold out in a heartbeat. With underground events the challenge is that you don't know
about the event at all. Or anything in between.

And that's why WeWantMoar exists. It gathers the event information in your desired areas. It's not tied to a single
ticket vendor, it will look from the places no one else dares to go. That came out wrong, but you get the idea...
It enhances the data by filling gaps using a variety of sources. Our community carries out the rest, things that are 
hidden in the depths of the internet. 

## WeWantMoar puts it all in the same jar

Once that scattered, incomplete data is gathered, the last part is simple. WeWantMoar informs you 
about the events that match to your specific musical taste and encourages you to join.

You might still miss a show now and then. But not because no one told you. You deserve moar.

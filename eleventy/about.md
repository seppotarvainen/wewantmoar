# But why, WeWantMoar?

Because life is too short for chasing down what is happening and where. We're building the WeWantMoar so you
don't have to follow various places to discover events of your taste. You don't even have to have a
friend who knows about that stuff. Yes, you don't need that person in your life anymore, how great!

## What do we offer at WeWantMoar?

How do you get an app you would use yourself? Well, you build your own.

What our solution brings to the table is pretty simple. We want to match our user's needs with accuracy.
Our mission is to inform about events that match to your unique taste where ever you are (or will be). You
might be interested if *Taylor Swift* has a concert anywhere in the world and at the same time you
might want to know about jazz events in cycling distance. Sometimes you're on a work trip and want to know ahead if
there's anything interesting happening. The use cases are different, like we all are.

Second thing is that we want to encourage people to go out and have fun. After the pandemic when the
world slowly started to open up again we found great joy in live events. We want even more people to
experience that. We used to do that when we were kids and teenagers, and continue to do that as adults. The world
without them is just grim.

## Other values

We're very privacy focused. We will not gather data of you just for the sake of it. The personal data you
provide stays personal on your device. Things that are sent to us are anonymised so that we're not able
to recognize you. That said, we will gather personal information in case it is needed due to a legislation.
In those cases, we let you know. Explicitly.

We want to free up time rather than take it. That is why our solution is not that *social*. You
already have those in your device and feel free to use them if they bring you joy. The reason for us to hang in
them is mainly about social events. For that use case, there's a bit too much clutter. That is one of the
reasons WeWantMoar exists.

Last thing is that this is built for everyone. This means that we will put efforts in accessibility of our application
even when we're not legally bound to do so. We just think it's common sense. Please inform us, if there's something to
improve in this matter.
